# Real-Time Color Detection
A Python application that detects and tracks specific colors (Yellow, Red, Blue) in real-time using computer vision. The program captures video from your webcam and draws bounding rectangles around detected colored objects.

## Description
This project uses OpenCV and PIL to perform real-time color detection through HSV color space conversion. The application can simultaneously detect multiple colors and highlight them with colored bounding boxes. It's designed to be lightweight and efficient for real-time processing.

## Features
 - Multi-color detection: Detects yellow, red, and blue objects simultaneously
 - Real-time processing: Live video feed with instant color detection
 - Visual feedback: Colored bounding rectangles around detected objects
 - Optimized HSV ranges: Tuned color ranges for better detection accuracy
 - Easy to extend: Simple structure to add more colors

## Installation Procedure
